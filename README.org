1. Don't kill too much, default `backward-kill-word' kills line above when
   cursor at beginning of line
2. For word 'getThingFromList', smart-kill-word will kill 'List', then 'From',
   'Thing' and 'get'

To use it:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (global-set-key [remap backward-kill-word] 'smart-kill-word)
#+END_SRC
